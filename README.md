All shortcuts can be removed, this menu allows you to open any menu or access anything on the server, by pressing **M** on the keyboard.

Setting up this resource is **not difficult** at all, you need the most basic knowledge of the LUA programming language, and if you do not know what you are doing, ***you can ask for help, which will surely be answered on and you will get help***.
